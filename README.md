# CVND FashionMNIST Classifier

This project is part of the Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree.
It builds step-by-step a FashionMNIST classifier, starting with simple visualization of feature maps and maxpooling layers.

The model contains 2 convolutional layers and maxpooling layer and 2 dense layers on the top. Dropout is used after the first linear layer to prevent overfitting. After the training for about 30 epochs the loss and the activation maps are visualized.
